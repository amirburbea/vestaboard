# Vestaboard Wordle

This is the Wordle game everyone knows (and some might love) rendering on the VestaBoard, complete with a React based client.

### Getting Set Up:

- For this to work, you must first follow the instructions in [VestaBoard Common](../Vestaboard.Common/README).
- You will also need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). I installed the latest version, but a recent LTS version should be fine.
- `yarn` package manager for NodeJS. You can install it by simply entering `npm i -g yarn` (and hit ENTER) at your command line.
- Inside this directory is a directory `fe`. Set your terminal to that directory.
- Type `yarn` at the command line (and hit ENTER), wait for it to download dependencies.
- Type `yarn build` at the command line (and hit ENTER).
