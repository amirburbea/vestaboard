# Vestaboard Common

This library comprises a set of shared utilities used to interact with the Vestaboard.

Requirements:

- The software runs on Microsoft's .NET 8.0+. Download and install the [SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) for your operating system (Linux/Windows/MacOS). If you're using Windows, an install of Visual Studio 2022/2023 with recent patches will have already included this.
- A Vestaboard obviously. For now this library has a hard-coded assumption that your Vestaboard has the network name `vestaboard.local`. You can set this in your hosts file or router - but that's beyond the scope of this document.
- Your Vestaboard will need to have "local API" enabled. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.vestaboard.com/docs/local-api/authentication) to get "local API" enabled on your Vestaboard.
